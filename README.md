# Number-Nebula
This code creates a fun guessing game, showing how users can play along. Here's how it works:

First, the code asks for the user's name and age.
Depending on their age:
If they're 12 or older, they jump right into the game, guessing a number.
If they're younger than 12, it checks if their parents said it's okay to play.
Once they're in, they guess a number.
The code checks their guess against the winning number:
If they get it right, they're told they won!
If they're too high or too low, it gives them a hint.
"It's a simple but engaging game that anyone can enjoy!"
